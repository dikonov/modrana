        they definitely went through the point. The cause turned out to be that
        their car was moving faster per second than was the size of the trigger circle.
        If they were going fast enough they could often "jump" ever a trigger circle
        between the navigation updates modRana generally does every second.

        To fix this modRana will compare current speed in meters per second and
        if it is close to the trigger circle size, it will increase the trigger circle
        size accordingly.

        #
        # I came up with this formula after a lot of experimentation with
        # gnuplot.  The idea is to give the user some simple parameters to
        # adjust yet let him have a lot of control.  There are five
        # parameters in the equation:
        #
        # low_speed	Speed below which the pre-announcement time is constant.
        # low_time	Announcement time at and below lowSpeed.
        # high_speed	Speed above which the announcement time is constant.
        # high_time	Announcement time at and above highSpeed.
        # power	Exponential power used in the formula; good values are 0.5-5
        #
        # The speeds are in m/s.  Obviously highXXX must be greater than lowXXX.
        # If power is 1.0, announcement times increase linearly above lowSpeed.
        # If power < 1.0, times rise rapidly just above lowSpeed and more
        # gradually approaching highSpeed.  If power > 1.0, times rise
        # gradually at first and rapidly near highSpeed.  I like power > 1.0.
        #
        # The reasoning is that at high speeds you are probably on a
        # motorway/freeway and will need extra time to get into the proper
        # lane to take your exit.  That reasoning is pretty harmless on a
        # high-speed two-lane road, but it breaks down if you are stuck in
        # heavy traffic on a four-lane freeway (like in Los Angeles
        # where I live) because you might need quite a while to work your
        # way across the traffic even though you're creeping along.  But I
        # don't know a good way to detect whether you're on a multi-lane road,
        # I chose speed as an acceptable proxy.
        #
        # Regardless of speed, we always warn a certain distance ahead (see
        # "distance" above).  That distance comes from the value in the current
        # step of the directions.
        #
        # BTW, if you want to use gnuplot to play with the curves, try:
        # max(a,b) = a > b ? a : b

        # gnuplot.  The idea is to give the user some simple parameters to
        # adjust yet let him have a lot of control.  There are five
        # parameters in the equation:
        #
        # low_speed	Speed below which the pre-announcement time is constant.
        # low_time	Announcement time at and below lowSpeed.
        # high_speed	Speed above which the announcement time is constant.
        # high_time	Announcement time at and above highSpeed.
        # power	Exponential power used in the formula; good values are 0.5-5
        #
        # The speeds are in m/s.  Obviously highXXX must be greater than lowXXX.
        # If power is 1.0, announcement times increase linearly above lowSpeed.
        # If power < 1.0, times rise rapidly just above lowSpeed and more
        # gradually approaching highSpeed.  If power > 1.0, times rise
        # gradually at first and rapidly near highSpeed.  I like power > 1.0.
        #
        # The reasoning is that at high speeds you are probably on a
        # motorway/freeway and will need extra time to get into the proper
        # lane to take your exit.  That reasoning is pretty harmless on a
        # high-speed two-lane road, but it breaks down if you are stuck in
        # heavy traffic on a four-lane freeway (like in Los Angeles
        # where I live) because you might need quite a while to work your
        # way across the traffic even though you're creeping along.  But I
        # don't know a good way to detect whether you're on a multi-lane road,
        # I chose speed as an acceptable proxy.
        #
